### TALKATIVE CALCULATOR

This is one of the first projects in [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Javascript basics curriculum.

The project covers building basic javascript functions and DOM manipulation so to spice things up I added some sounds and gave my calculator a bit of a personality. It really doesn't like it when you try to divide by zero.

The project is available live [HERE](https://kikupiku.github.io/Calculator/)
